simplecolors is designed to generate hex codes using uniformly named
colors.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `simplecolors` from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=simplecolors) with:

``` r
install.packages("simplecolors")
```

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/rjake/simplecolors) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("rjake/simplecolors")
```

## Usage

The idea is to have a simpler way of accessing color values that is
intuitive and easy to remember. Colors can be called using `sc()` or by
using the various palette tools `sc_across()`, `sc_blue()`, etc. To see
all available colors use `show_colors()`

The colors follow a pattern of `[saturation]` `[color name]`
`[lightness]`
